Possible Next Steps
- Some next steps could be to test with a custom testing dataset and with different
  model layers to increase model accuracy. The model can also be trained with a
  larger variety of training data to make it generalize to more types of data which
  would make it more useful in real world applications.

Ways to Improve Data Collection of Customer
- I'm not quite sure if this means the training data used was collected by the
  customer, but that's how I interpret it. The main thing needed to imrove the data
  collection is to know more specifics about what the customer is trying to use
  the detection algorithm for. This can help to understand how to tailor the
  training data to be either more generalized or of a certain background or phone type.
